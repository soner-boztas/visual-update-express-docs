# Making a Donation

> Visual Update has been available completely free of charge for over 10 years. Our mission is  to offer developers a 
free alternative to distribute their own software applications with powerful update systems.
The development of Visual Update is entirely based on the financial support of its users.
Therefore, we ask everyone who loves our software as much as we do to support the development with a donation.
Thanks! :octicons-heart-fill-24:
