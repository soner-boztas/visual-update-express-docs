# Reporting a Bug

We set high standards for ourselves and always strive to deliver high quality to Visual Update Express users. However,
no software application is free from defects. If you think you have found a bug, please report it in our
[GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/soner-boztas/installforge), which is managed under the InstallForge project.


If you want to report a bug, please provide us with the following information:

- Version of Visual Update Express you are using (e.g. `1.2.0`)
- Operating system of the affected [build environment] or [target environment] (e.g. `Windows 11`)
- Detailed description of the bug, including:
    - All necessary steps to reproduce the bug
    - Relevant input data (Visual Update Express configuration)
    - Relevant output data
    - Expected behavior, i.e. the behavior that would be observed in the absence of the bug.

!!! tip

    In order to determine the version of Visual Update Express you are using, click `Build` in the left pane of the
    InstallForge main application window and take a look at the log widget appearing on the main pane.
