# Introduction

Visual Update is an online update solution based on HTTP/S enabling software developers/vendors to ship their
software products together with automated update systems. Those systems are important to take away all the worries about
giving your end-users the possibility to keep your product up to date in a very convenient way.

Despite the fact that Visual Update makes use of scripts in order to accomplish the above-mentioned goal, it is
yet outstanding with ease of use and efficiency. The scripting interface will allow you not only to create simple but
also powerful update systems for your own software products.
