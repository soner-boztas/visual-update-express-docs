# Path Constants

## Introduction

Visual Update supports various predefined constants enclosed in `<` `>` characters, that can be used in
the update script (see [Update Script](update-script.md)).
These constants are validated by the native update engine during runtime and can be used to increase the flexibility of
your update process.

!!! info

    All predefined constant names are case-insensitive.

## Path Constants

    The resolved paths **do** contain a trailing backslash (`\`).
